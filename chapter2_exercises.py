# Exercises for chapter 2:

#2.1 In this example the Python is converting 02132 into a decimal which is 1114.
#The binary for this number is 10001011010, I achieved this using http://ncalculators.com/number-conversion/octal-to-binary-hexa-decimal-converter.htm
# Converting these values using my own arithmatic was difficult.


#2.2 The output is 6. 
print "5"
print "x = 5"
print "x + 1"
5 ; x = 5
print x + 1

#2.3

#1.) 8, int
width = 17
print width / 2
print type (width / 2)

#2) 8.5, Float
print width / 2.0
print type (width/2.0)

#3) 4.0, float
height = 12.0
print height / 3
print type (height / 3)

#4) 11, int
print 1 + 2 * 5
print type (1 + 2 * 5)

#5) ....., string
delimiter = '.'
print '.' * 5
print type ('.' * 5)

#2.4

#1.) Answer = 392.5

radius = 5
pi = 3.14
print (4 / 3) * (pi) * (5 * 5 * 5)


#2.) This problem confuses me. 

b = (24.95)
d = ((0.6) * (b))
c = (59)
print d * 60 + 3.00 + 0.75 * c


# 2.4.3) 38 minutes and 12 seconds.
